# Game Engine Scope

The game engine defines the actors and environment.

## Players
In principle, the game is between two or more players, which each control a set of units.


## Units
The game is turn based. Each unit will get its turn separately. 
The engine will be agnostic to the particular game rules, which will be defined separately


## MaThe Board
The game is played on the game board. 
In this version, the board will be a square grid.
Terrain features can be distributed around the map, covering specific squares. Their properties are defined in the rule system.
